    description: Detects the loading of drivers via 'SeLoadDriverPrivilege' required
      to load or unload a device driver. With this privilege, the user can dynamically
      load and unload device drivers or other code in to kernel mode. This user right
      does not apply to Plug and Play device drivers. If you exclude privileged users/admins
      and processes, which are allowed to do so, you are maybe left with bad programs
      trying to load malicious kernel drivers. This will detect Ghost-In-The-Logs
      (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs) and the usage of Sysinternals
      and various other tools. So you have to work with a whitelist to find the bad
      stuff.
    falsepositives:
    - Other legimate tools loading drivers. There are some: Sysinternals, CPU-Z, AVs
        etc. - but not much. You have to baseline this according to your used products
        and allowed tools. Also try to exclude users, which are allowed to load drivers.
