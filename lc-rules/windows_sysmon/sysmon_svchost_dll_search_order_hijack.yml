    description: IKEEXT and SessionEnv service, as they call LoadLibrary on files
      that do not exist within C:\Windows\System32\ by default. An attacker can place
      their malicious logic within the PROCESS_ATTACH block of their library and restart
      the aforementioned services "svchost.exe -k netsvcs" to gain code execution
      on a remote machine.
